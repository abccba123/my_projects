'''
(Count occurrences of numbers) Write a program that reads an unspecified number
of integers and finds the ones that have the most occurrences. For example, if
you enter 2 3 40 3 5 4 â€“3 3 3 2 0, the number 3 occurs most often. Enter all numbers
in one line. If not one but several numbers have the most occurrences, all of
them should be reported. For example, since 9 and 3 appear twice in the list 9 30
3 9 3 2 4, both occurrences should be reported.
