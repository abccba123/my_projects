'''
(Compute the weekly hours for each employee) Suppose the weekly hours for all
employees are stored in a table. Each row records an employeeâ€™s seven-day work
hours with seven columns. For example, the following table stores the work hours
for eight employees. Write a program that displays employees and their total hours
in decreasing order of the total hours.
